# Olist E-Commerce Analytics

##  Introduction

The rapid growth of the e-commerce industry generates massive datasets that can be leveraged to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, logistics, and overall business performance.  
This project, **"Olist E-Commerce Analytics"**, uses real-world data from a leading Brazilian e-commerce platform to perform:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify patterns in customer behavior, sales, delivery delays, and seller efficiency.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilize NLP techniques to analyze customer reviews for better understanding of satisfaction levels.  
- **Sales Prediction:** Apply machine learning and time series models to forecast future sales trends for informed decision-making.

##  Problem Statement

E-commerce businesses face challenges such as:
- Understanding customer emotions beyond numeric ratings  
- Identifying and reducing delivery delays  
- Detecting buying patterns and demand trends  
- Forecasting future sales for optimized inventory and marketing strategies  

This project combines **EDA, Sentiment Analysis, and Predictive Modeling** to provide data-driven solutions addressing these challenges.
